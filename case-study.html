            <p>
              My process involved taking time to understand and experience
              Python and Django. Then I set my intention to develop a clean and
              modern application that was available to all screen sizes and had
              an intuitive and simple user-flow. I was also guided and got many
              resources from CareerFoundry in developing this application.

              A responsive recipe application that allows different users to
              login, add recipes, search recipes, and see visuals of data such
              as a pie chart relating to different recipes. And to give me more
              tools and experience on my web development journey.

      <h2 class="roadblock-title">Roadblock</h2>
      <div class="roadblock-content">
        <div class="stat-images">
          <img
            src="img/Recipe App Stat 1.png"
            alt="Recipe App Statistics Top Half"
          />
          <img
            src="img/Recipe App Stat 2.png"
            alt="Recipe App Statistics Bottom Half"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="roadblock-text">
          <p>
            The original idea was to create a statistics page where users could
            search an ingredient and retrieve statistics and visuals of data
            about recipes related to that ingredient. And there would be links
            beneath the statistics and data visuals to click on the actual
            recipe.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I realized is that when users would search an ingredient they
            would not be able to see the recipes related to the search without
            scrolling down as shown in the images above. This made the
            statistics page feeling less intuitive and so I chose to redesign my
            user flow.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="stat-images">
          <img
            src="img/Recipe Search Image.png"
            alt="recipe home/search image"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="roadblock-text2">
          <p>
            I then chose to separate my statistics and recipe search functions.
            The statistics would have its own page while the search for recipes
            would be relocated on the home page. This gave the home page a
            little more functionality while showing users all of the recipes
            when they first logged in.

        <div class="final-container">

        <div class="final-text">
          <p>
            All objectives were achieved and met with a clean and modern design!
            Other challenges arose like understanding why my difficulty function
            was not being executed when a new recipe was entered. But after
            playing with models within Django and understanding how to use
            functions within a model I was able to have a recipe calculate its
            difficulty level.

          <p>
            I was content with the final product! Looking back there would be a
            couple things I would do differently:
          </p>
          <p>
            - After deploying my project to Heroku, I learned that Heroku would
            not actually be the best choice to deploy my project due to Heroku
            not supporting the usage of static images with their free plan. This
            just reminded me that choosing which website to deploy your
            application on is crucial and making sure they fit all your needs
            and requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            - I would be a little bit more cautious when downloading
            dependencies. I ran into issues deploying my application due to
            certain dependencies clashing with others or certain dependencies
            needing other dependencies to be a certain version.
          </p>
          <img src="img/journaling-image.jpg" alt="image of journaling" />
          <p>
            If I wanted to further develop and improve this application I would:
          </p>
          <p>- Develop a register new user page.</p>
          <p>
            - I would re-design the recipe page. To enhance the look of the page
            and make it more user-friendly. I would also want to organize
            recipes with something like protein categories or something that
            only takes under 10 minutes to cook. That way users could find
            recipes with chicken or beef, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            - I would give users the option to make a favorite recipes list.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, this journey and exploration was very valuable in helping
            me to learn about the full-stack web development process using
            Python, Django, and Heroku. It gave more clarity in seeing how
            everything connects and showed me the potential in how to create a
            more large-scale application from the ground up.
